## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

  ### PROJECT : The Simple Calculator
  ### OBJECTIVE :
  The objective of the project is to create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
  It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

    a. The divide function checks if the second number (num2) is zero to prevent division by zero errors.
    b. The main function checks if the user's input is valid (i.e., one of the choices 1, 2, 3, 4,). If not, it prints "Invalid operation entered"

## RUN THE CODE :
